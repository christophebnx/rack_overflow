# Decisions

Each entry: the decision, why, and what it rules out. Do not reverse a decision silently: add a new entry that supersedes it (skill `/add-decision`).

## Tooling

**D-001 — Python ≥ 3.12, managed with uv; `uv.lock` is versioned.**
One tool for the interpreter, the virtual environment, dependencies and the lock file. CI runs `uv sync --locked`, so a dependency change without a lock update fails. Rejected: pip + requirements files (no lock of transitive versions), Poetry (slower, second tool).

**D-002 — Lint and format with ruff; duplicate code detected with pylint `duplicate-code`.**
Ruff runs in CI, in pre-commit and after every Claude Code edit (`.claude/hooks/format.py`). Pylint runs only its duplicate-code checker: it is the mechanical half of the one-responsibility rule (D-006); the reviewer agent covers the other half.

## Code structure

**D-003 — Source layout `src/<package>/`, pure `domain/` layer at the centre.**
`domain/` holds business rules and imports nothing else from the project; it reads no file, network, clock or environment (callers pass them in). Outer layers depend on it, never the reverse. Enforced by `tests/unit/test_layering.py`. Why: business rules stay testable in isolation and do not change when storage or interfaces change.

**D-004 — The CLI is a technical tool: English messages, explicit exit codes.**
0 success, 1 error, 2 usage. Errors print `<prog>: error: <message>` on stderr. Tests call `main([...])` in-process.

**D-005 — Atomic file writes only.**
Every user or state file is written by `storage/files.atomic_write` (temp file in the same folder, fsync, rename, folder fsync). A crash leaves the old file or the new one, never a mix.

**D-006 — One responsibility, one implementation.**
Each responsibility has exactly one implementation, listed in the responsibility map of `docs/architecture.md`. Duplication with a different implementation is a blocking review finding. Similar-looking code with a different responsibility is allowed.

## Working with Claude Code

**D-007 — Every change goes through `/feature`: architect → (ui-designer) → developer → tester → reviewer → documentation.**
Each agent has one job, limited tools and a ten-line report; details go into `docs/`. The architect writes a design note in `docs/architecture/` before any code. Why: decisions and designs survive the conversation, and the review checks the change against written rules rather than memory.

**D-008 — Autonomous build from the roadmap, state in `docs/progress.md`.**
`/build-roadmap` runs the milestones of `docs/roadmap.md` in order and stops on documented conditions (repeated failures, a decision to supersede, anything only the user can provide), writing `BLOCKED` and the question in `docs/progress.md`.

**D-009 — Claude Code never reads secrets and never commits or pushes on `main`.**
Enforced by `permissions.deny` in `.claude/settings.json` and by the PreToolUse hook `.claude/hooks/guard_paths.py` (secret files, protected folders, `git commit` and `git push` on `main`). Force-push, hard reset and branch deletion are denied. The user merges into `main` through pull requests.

**D-010 — Conventional Commits with a `Milestone:` footer, checked by a commit-msg hook.**
`tools/check_commit_message.py` (installed by `uv run pre-commit install`) rejects malformed messages. The footer ties every commit to a roadmap item. Git's own merge, revert and fixup messages pass unchecked.

**D-011 — English for code and repository text; the user language for what the end user sees.**
Code, identifiers, docs, prompts, agents, skills and commits in English. UI strings and exported content in the user language, from locale files.

## Project

TODO(project): add the project's own decisions from D-012 on.

## Project

**D-012 — No automatic CI until V1 is done; checks run locally.**
GitHub Actions minutes cost money, so the workflow runs only on manual dispatch (`workflow_dispatch`). Until V1 is complete, the definition of done is checked locally: tests (`not live`), ruff and duplicate-code, run by the tester and reviewer agents and by pre-commit. Once V1 is done, a minimal CI is designed (which jobs, which OS) and recorded in a new decision. Refines D-001 and D-002 (the "runs in CI" parts apply only to manual runs). Rules out: automatic runs on push or pull request, the three-OS matrix as a default. Status: approved by the user on 2026-11-03.

**D-013 — V1 is served over plain HTTP; transport security is deferred to V2.**
During development the app is reachable on the LAN only, with no WAN exposure. Once in use, the server listens on a high, non-standard port (from configuration) forwarded through the DDNS, without reverse proxy or certificate. Why: single user, unadvertised app, simpler deployment. Accepted risk: data and the session cookie travel in clear. Kept in V1: per-device authentication, `HttpOnly` / `SameSite=Strict` cookie, `Origin` check and JSON-only requests. The cookie `Secure` flag and HSTS depend on a configuration switch, so V2 enables HTTPS without code change. Status: approved by the user on 2026-11-03.
